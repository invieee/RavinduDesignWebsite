                    Why do you want to Hide Away? To escape? To leave the dread and monotony of life?
                    Each bottle captures the essence of the beauty of Australia, combining the artworks of the ‘She-oak and Sunlight Collection’ which captures the landscape masterfully with a brush.

                    <br>
                    These artworks, framed by the bottle, are used to capture a sense of place and bring it into your home.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With each sip of Hide Away, you are transported to a place where you are safe and secure, yet also connecting with a sense of place, all without leaving your seat.
                    The main reason people drink gin is to indulge in the aromatics and botanicals present in the bottle, to mellow out and relax. Understanding that, using the expressed botanical notes, a sense of place can be created. 
                    A moment in time where the only focus is yourself and your immediate surroundings, hidden away from the rest of the world. To create your own space, is the intention of the brand, by focusing on imagery and branding to capture those notes.
