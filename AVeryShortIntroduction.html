                <p class="Description">
                    Understanding the problem with the current books was the first step in the redesign. It used an undesirable font, didn’t communicate the book's contents effectively, and didn’t increase engagement of the book through the cover.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This new redesign covers all those effectively, bringing in a wider appeal, to the general audience and even collectors. Through a curated palette of earthy tones and a simple shape that represents a doorway into the book, a person can pick up ‘A Very Short Introduction’ and gain an understanding of the contents of the book without it being overwhelming or ham-fisted with irrelevant information.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Photo selection is an important part of the cover, it needs to represent the book effectively, and sometimes the book doesn’t have an instant pictorial representation. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For Example, Philosophy of Science mentions the understanding of scientific methodology and understanding, and how certain ideas can change with new information, thus the photo selected is a telescope looking into the stars, both looking for understanding and how our knowledge of space has changed.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The photo is then treated, applying a halftone effect and colour gradient that represents the category the book falls under, in this case, science.
